# Irreducible Representation Calculator

**Technologies**: Java, XML, Android Studio, Git  
**Duration**: Sep. 2019 â€“ Dec. 2019

## Description

The **Irreducible Representation Calculator** is an Android app developed in collaboration with a team for the chemistry department. The app is designed to assist inorganic chemistry students in calculating reducible forms for a wide range of chemical point groups. 

## Features & Contributions

- **Collaboration**: Worked alongside a team to develop an app specifically tailored for inorganic chemistry students.
- **User Interface**: Programmed parts of the user interface components using XML files to ensure a smooth and user-friendly experience.
- **Backend Calculations**: Developed most of the backend logic to handle the complex calculations for reducible and irreducible representations.
- **App Integration**: Combined two pre-existing chemistry apps, **Point Group Finder** and **Tanabe-Sugano Slider**, to create a unified application, **iChem**, providing a comprehensive toolset for users.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: For implementing the core app logic.
- **XML**: For creating and styling user interface components.
- **Android Studio**: The integrated development environment (IDE) used to develop the app.
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.
